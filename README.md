# Customer_behavior_analysis
Customer Behavior Analysis project using Python, SQL and Power BI to explore spending patterns, subscription behavior, product performance, age-group trends, and revenue drivers. The dashboard highlights key insights to help understand customer habits and business performance.

Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Pipeline
Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from loading a dataset in Python to building a fully interactive Power BI dashboard. It highlights my skills in Python (EDA & Cleaning), SQL Server (Querying), Data Visualization, and Report Creation.
The goal of the project is to extract meaningful insights, improve decision-making, and showcase a practical analytics pipeline.

 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information related to customer purchases (or relevant domain).
Includes fields such as: customer details, products, sales metrics, dates, and transaction information.
Source: Public dataset (Kaggle) / Provided dataset.

Tools & Technologies
Python – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA and data cleaning
SQL Server – Running complex queries, joins, aggregations
Power BI – Building dashboards & visual insights
Microsoft Excel – Basic data checks (if used)
Gamma App – For designing the project presentation
GitHub – Version control and project documentation

Project Steps
Data Loading (Python)
Imported dataset using Pandas
Checked data types, missing values, duplicates
Performed initial understanding of dataset shape and structure

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics (mean, median, count, distribution)
Univariate & bivariate analysis
Outlier detection
Visualization of key patterns and relationships

Data Cleaning
Handled missing values
Removed duplicates
Treated outliers
Feature formatting (date conversion, category encoding, etc.)
Cleaned dataset exported for SQL & Power BI

SQL Analysis (SQL Server)
Created database & imported cleaned data
Executed analytical queries including:
Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
Filtering & grouping
Business-oriented queries (sales, customers, trends)

Power BI Dashboard
Connected SQL data to Power BI
Built interactive visuals:
Sales trends
Customer segmentation
Category performance
KPIs and drill-down insights
Added slicers for dynamic exploration

Report Creation
Summarized insights, metrics, and findings
Highlighted key business recommendations
Structured report using clear visuals and explanations

Presentation (Gamma)
Final project presentation built using Gamma App
Includes:
Project goal
Process flow
Insights & dashboards
Recommendations

Key Results & Insights
Identified important patterns in customer behaviour
Highlighted top-performing categories/products
Found factors influencing revenue and retention
Provided actionable business recommendations
