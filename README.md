# Customer_behavior_analysis

Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Pipeline


Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from loading a dataset in Python to building a fully interactive Power BI dashboard. It highlights my skills in Python (EDA and Cleaning), SQL Server (Querying), Data Visualization, Report Creation, and Presentation Building.
The objective is to extract meaningful insights that support business decision-making.


Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information related to customer purchases (or relevant domain).

Includes fields such as customer details, product information, sales metrics, dates, and transaction data.

Source: Public dataset (Kaggle) or provided dataset.

Tools and Technologies

Python – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn

SQL Server – For running analytical queries

Power BI – For building dashboards

Excel – For additional data checks (optional)

Gamma App – For creating the final presentation

GitHub – For version control and documentation


Project Steps
1. Data Loading (Python)

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Verified data types, column structure, missing values, and dataset shape


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated summary statistics

Performed univariate and bivariate analysis

Created visualizations to understand distributions and correlations

Identified outliers and trends


3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Treated outliers

Formatted columns (dates, categories, numerical fields)

Exported the cleaned dataset for SQL and Power BI


4. SQL Analysis (SQL Server)

Created a database and imported the cleaned dataset

Executed queries involving aggregations, filtering, and grouping

Performed business-oriented analysis such as revenue trends, customer segmentation, and product performance


5. Power BI Dashboard

Connected SQL Server data to Power BI

Designed interactive dashboards with visuals such as KPI cards, bar charts, line charts, and tables

Added filters and slicers for deeper analysis

Highlighted key business insights


6. Report Creation

Summarized insights, findings, and important metrics

Explained trends and business recommendations

Supported the report with visual evidence


7. Presentation (Gamma)

Created a structured project presentation

Included the objective, methodology, dashboard screenshots, and final insights

Key Results and Insights

Identified patterns in customer behavior

Highlighted top-performing products or categories

Analyzed revenue trends and influencing factors

Derived actionable recommendations for the business




How to Run the Project
Requirements

Python 3.x

Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

SQL Server along with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Power BI Desktop


Steps

Clone the repository

Open and run the Python notebook to perform EDA and cleaning

Import the cleaned CSV file into SQL Server

Execute the SQL queries from the SQL script

Open the Power BI (.pbix) file to explore the dashboard

Review the project report and Gamma presentation
